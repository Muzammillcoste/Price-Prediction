## Usage

### Starting the Flask Server

1. Open the main folder ML_PROJECT in Visual Studio Code.
2. Open the terminal and check if the current directory is ML_PROJECT.
   - If not, navigate to the ML_PROJECT directory.
3. Change to the APIs directory:
   ```bash
   cd APIs
   ```
4. Run the following command to start the local server:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Launching the Web Application

1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the crypto_models directory:
   ```bash
   cd crypto_models
   ```
2. Start the web application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. The application will now be running on your local server. Switch to your browser to interact with it.
